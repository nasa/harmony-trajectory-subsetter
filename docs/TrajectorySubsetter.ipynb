    "# Segmented Trajectory Subsetter documentation and examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contact:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slack:** #sds, #harmony-service-providers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email:** david.p.auty@nasa.gov, owen.m.littlejohns@nasa.gov.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of this notebook is to demonstrate the capabilities the Segmented Trajectory Subsetter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variable subsetting.\n",
    "* Temporal subsetting.\n",
    "* Bounding box spatial subsetting.\n",
    "* Polygon spatial subsetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distinctions from other services:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Works on trajectory, rather than swath data (1-D, usually with a time dimension).\n",
    "* Preserves continuity of photon segment indices.\n",
    "* Configured for Cloud-hosted GEDI L4A test collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Segmented trajectories:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/segmented_trajectory.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1:** Annotated image from Earthdata Search to illustrate segmented trajectory collections. The granule selected has a trajectory split into continuous segments. In the example above, the bounding box shows a spatial subset request that requires the removal of some of the segments. The output also will not be continuous and so the segments will need to be re-indexed to ensure the output contains continuous indices. (Note: Real trajectory segments are much shorter than those shown in this image)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heritage:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Harmony service is a new, Python-based wrapper on the existing SDPS Trajectory Subsetter on-premises service. This \n",
    "on-premises service is underpinned by a C++ binary that is invoked via the EOSDIS Service Interface (ESI) and specific tool adapters. The Trajectory Subsetter has been used on-premises to support trajectory collections for missions such as SMAP and ICESat-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "Harmony, Python-based infrastructure replaces the ESI and tool adapters in the on-premises stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/TS_sequence_diagram.png)\n",
    "**Figure 2:** Sequence flow of the Trajectory Subsetter Harmony backend service. A Harmony request is received for a collection associated with that service. Harmony constructs a message and sends it to the Trajectory Subsetter. The `HarmonyAdapter` class within the backend service downloads the granule and then translates the Harmony message parameters into arguments for a call to the C++ binary. The C++ binary is invoked, with its output status captures, to ensure success. Finally, the transformed output is staged to S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trajectory data.\n",
    "* Cloud-hosted data (best ingested via Cumulus).\n",
    "* UMM-C and UMM-G records, again best created via Cumulus, including `GET DATA` related URL.\n",
    "* UMM-Var records associated with the collection.\n",
    "* A UMM-S record (for each production DAAC provider), with that UMM-S concept ID listed against the Trajectory Subsetter service in [services.yml](https://github.com/nasa/harmony/blob/main/config/services.yml).\n",
    "* Association between the UMM-C record(s) for your collection(s) and the UMM-S record.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The following examples will use `harmony-py` (see: [here](https://github.com/nasa/harmony-py)) to make requests to Harmony. `harmony-py` is distributed via the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/harmony-py/)), and can be installed to your current Python environment via Pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ pip install harmony-py\n",

    "\n",
    "Other Python packages used by this notebook (for evaluating output):\n",
    "\n",
    "* cartopy\n",
    "* matplotlib\n",
    "* netCDF4\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial set-up\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell imports standard classes from `harmony-py` and establishes a client to make requests to the UAT environment of Harmony. It also sets up a collection instance for the GEDI L4A collection, as hosted in the EEDTEST provider (C1242267295-EEDTEST)."
