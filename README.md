# Segmented Trajectory Subsetter.

This repository contains the source code and configuration scripts for the
Data Services segmented trajectory subsetter.

### Repository branching:

This repository contains two long-lived branches: `master` and `dev`. The
`master` branch will contain only code identified for an SDPS release. The
`dev` branch contains the most recent code deployed to Harmony (Sandbox, SIT,
and likely UAT). It also is equivalent to the SDPS `relb` ClearCase view. All
feature work should be added via pull request (PR) with a target branch of
`dev`.
